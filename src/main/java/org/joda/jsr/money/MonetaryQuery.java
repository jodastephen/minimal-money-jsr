/**
 * Strategy for querying a monetary amount.
 * <p>
 * Queries are a key tool for extracting information from monetary amounts.
 * They match the strategy design pattern, allowing different types of
 * query to be easily captured.
 * Examples might be a query that checks if the amount is positive, or
 * one that extracts the currency as a symbol.
 * <p>
 * There are two equivalent ways of using a {@code MonetaryQuery}.
 * The first is to invoke the method on this interface.
 * The second is to use {@link MonetaryAmount#query(MonetaryQuery)}:
 * <pre>
 *   // these two lines are equivalent, but the second approach is recommended
 *   monetary = thisQuery.queryFrom(monetary);
 *   monetary = monetary.query(thisQuery);
 * </pre>
 * It is recommended to use the second approach, {@code query(MonetaryQuery)},
 * as it is a lot clearer to read in code.
 * 
 * <h4>Implementation specification</h4>
 * This interface places no restrictions on the mutability of implementations,
 * however immutability is strongly recommended.
