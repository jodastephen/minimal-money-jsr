/**
 * A amount of money.
 * <p>
 * This interface represents a quantity of money, stored as a numeric amount
 * in a single {@link CurrencyUnit currency}.
 * <p>
 * The amount is represented as rational number, consisting of three parts.
 * The main part is the whole number of currency units, such as US dollars.
 * The secondary parts are the numerator and denominator of the fraction of the currency unit.
 * For example, '12 dollars and 25 cents' will have a whole number amount of
 * '12', a numerator of '25 and a denominator of '100'. A similar value would
 * be '12 and one quarter dollars' where the numerator would be '1 'and the
 * denominator '4'.
 * <p>
 * This approach allows up to 18 decimal digits as well as any other fraction
 * such as one third or two sevenths.
 * By representing a fraction, the intermediate step in calculations can be expressed.
 * <p>
 * It is intended that applications declare method signatures and variables
 * in terms of the concrete type implementing this interface, rather than
 * this interface.
 * 
 * <h4>Implementation specification</h4>
 * This interface places no restrictions on the mutability of implementations,
 * however immutability is strongly recommended.
 * Implementations should be serializable wherever possible.
